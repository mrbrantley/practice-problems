# practice-problems

This is a repo of code challenges from Learn Academy and Leetcode. My goal is to use Visual Studio Code IDE to practice coding and solve problems I may see in a coding interview.

My stretch goal is to create a website that can be interacted with to show the logic working in real-time.
